## Problem

 Write a program that prompts the user for two positive integers, and then
 prints the results of the following operations on those two numbers: addition,
 subtraction, product, quotient, remainder, and power. Do not worry about
 validating the input.
 
 ### Input
 
 Two Integers
 
 ### Output
 
 Six equations
 
 ## Examples
 
 ==> Enter the first number:
23
==> Enter the second number:
17
==> 23 + 17 = 40
==> 23 - 17 = 6
==> 23 * 17 = 391
==> 23 / 17 = 1
==> 23 % 17 = 6
==> 23 ** 17 = 141050039560662968926103

## Data Structure

Nothing crazy, just some variables

## Algorithm

Get the two numbers, save as variables
Method for each equation, which returns the result
